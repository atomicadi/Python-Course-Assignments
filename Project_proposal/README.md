The theory of reaction rates, published almost simultaneously by Henry Eyring and M. G. Evans, and M. Polanyi in 1935, is now referred to as conventional transition-state theory (CTST). This theory involves the same assumptions and approximations used in the calculations of equilibrium constants using statistical mechanics.\
So after merging the statistical mechanics and chemical equilibrium and to calculate the CTST rate constant, the partition functins of both the reactants and the activated complex are needed. The total partition function of a molecule can be written as:
<p align="center">


$$
q = \sum_i g_i e^{-\frac{ε_i}{k_BT}} ...... (1)
$$


</p>

Where the summation is taken over all energy levels. The energy ε<sub>i</sub> is the energy of the i<sup>th</sup> state relative to the zero-point energy, and g<sub>i</sub> is the degeneracy. Usually, it is assume that the various types of energy- electronic, vibrational, rotational, and translational- are independent of one another. So, the total energy corresponding to the i<sup>th</sup> energy state is thus expressed as the sum of the different types of energies:
<p align="center">


$$
ε_i = e_i + ν_i + r_i + t_i  ...... (2)
$$


</p>

Where, e<sub>i</sub> = electronic energy, ν<sub>i</sub> = vibrational energy, r<sub>i</sub> = rotational energy, and t<sub>i</sub> = translational energy. So, using equation (2), equation (1) can be written as:
<p align="center">


$$
q = \sum_i g_{e_i} e^{-\frac{e_i}{k_BT}}  g_{ν_i} e^{-\frac{ν_i}{k_BT}}  g_{r_i} e^{-\frac{r_i}{k_BT}}  g_{t_i} e^{-\frac{t_i}{k_BT}}  ...... (3)
$$


</p>

Omitting the degeneracy, equation (3) may be written as:
<p align="center">


$$
q = q_{e} q_{ν} q_{r} q_{t}  ...... (4)
$$


</p>

Where, q<sub>e</sub> (electronic), q<sub>ν</sub> (vibrational), q<sub>r</sub> (rotational), and q<sub>t</sub> (translational) are separate partition functions, each referring to one type of energy. At ordinary temperatures, the excited electronic levels of an atom or molecule are
usually too high to make a significant contribution to the partition function, and equation (4) becomes,
<p align="center">


$$
q = q_{ν} q_{r} q_{t}  ...... (5)
$$


</p>

The formula of separate partition functions are:
<p align="center">


$$
q_{ν} (per-normal-mode) =  \frac{1}{(1 - e^{-\frac{hν}{k_BT}})}  ...... (6)
$$

$$
q_{r} (linear-molecule) =  \frac{8π^2Ik_BT}{σh^2}  ...... (7)
$$

$$
q_{r} (nonlinear-molecule) =  \frac{8π^2(8π^3I_AI_BI_C)^{1/2}(k_BT)^{3/2}}{σh^3}  ...... (8)
$$

$$
q_{t} =  \frac{(2πmk_BT)^{3/2}}{h^2}  ...... (9)
$$
</p>

Where, h = Planck constant, ν = normal-mode vibrational frequency, k<sub>B</sub> = Boltzmann constant, T = absolute temperature, I = moment of inertia for the linear molecule, (I<sub>A</sub>,I<sub>B</sub>, and I<sub>C</sub>) = moment of inertia for a nonlinear molecule about three axes at right angles, σ = symmetry number, m = mass of molecule

Now, if a reaction is
<p align="center">


$$
A + B => a^{‡} => C + D 
$$


</p> 
then using all the formulas, finally the CSTS rate constant equation becomes,
<p align="center">


$$
k = \frac{k_BT}{h} \frac{q_{‡}}{q_A q_B} e^{-\frac{E_0}{RT}}  ...... (10)
$$


</p>

Where, q<sub>‡</sub> is the total partition function of activated complex, q<sub>A</sub> and q<sub>B</sub> are the total partition function of reactant A and B respectively, E<sub>0</sub> = Barrier hight, and R = Gas constant.


In this project, the CTST rate constant is calculated by solving equation (10) through Fortran programming. Herein 3 files (**mod_1_requirement_scratch.f90**, **mod2_partition.f90**, and **mother.f90**) are generated in which **mod_1_requirement_scratch.f90** is a module file that conatains the requirement values and calculations to solve the partition functions (eg Total mass, moment of inertia etc.). For solving the moment of inertia, the moment of inertia tensor (3x3) is generated first using the equations,
<p align="center">


$$
I_{xx} = \sum_im_i(y_i^2 + z_i^2)  ......(11)
$$


$$
I_{yy} = \sum_im_i(z_i^2 + x_i^2)   ......(12)
$$


$$
I_{zz} = \sum_im_i(x_i^2 + y_i^2)  ......(13)
$$


$$
I_{xy} = -\sum_im_ix_iy_i = I_{yx}  ......(14)
$$


$$
I_{xz} = -\sum_im_ix_iz_i = I_{zx}  ......(15)
$$


$$
I_{yz} = -\sum_im_iy_iz_i = I_{zy}  ......(16)
$$


</p>

Finally, using equations (11)-(16), the moment of inertia tensor is generated.
  | I<sub>xx</sub> | I<sub>xy</sub> | I<sub>xz</sub> |
  |----------------|----------------|----------------|
  | I<sub>yx</sub> | I<sub>yy</sub> | I<sub>yz</sub> |
  | I<sub>zx</sub> | I<sub>zy</sub> | I<sub>zz</sub> |

To obtain the values of moment of inertia, the tensor matrix is diagonalized using the external libraries (LAPACK and BLAS) and used according to the conditions of molecular types (eg, Linear, Spherical top, Prolet-symmertic top, etc.). On the other hand, **mod2_partition.f90** is the second module file which conatins the calculations of parition functions using the values of module file 1 and also the calculation of CTST rate constant.\
Beside that **mother.f90** is the main file which gathered all the information by the user from the input file (**H_HBr.inp**) and link all the files through the command,
```
gfortran -o TST mod_1_requirement_scratch.f90 mod2_partition.f90 mother.f90 -llapack -lblas
```
and gives the executable file (**TST**), and at the end by typing a simple command (```./TST```) to run the executable file the result can be gererated as the form of a outpul file, **H_HBr.out**.
